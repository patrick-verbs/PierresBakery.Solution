## Description

A __C# application__ to simulate ordering bread & pastries at a bakery &mdash; by typing into the stark void of a command-line console, _like real humans do at real bakeries._

## Setup and Use

### Prerequisites

- [.NET 5 SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet/5.0)
- A text editor like [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
- A command line interface like Terminal or GitBash to run and interact with the console app

### Installation

1. Clone the repository: `$ git clone {clone link}`
2. Navigate to the `{PierresBakery.Solution}` directory on your computer
3. Open with your preferred text editor to view the code base
4. To run the console app:
   - Navigate to `{PierresBakery.Solution/PierresBakery}` in your command line
   - Run the command `dotnet restore` to restore the dependencies that are listed in `{PierresBakery.csproj}`
   - Run the command `dotnet build` to build the project and its dependencies into a set of binaries
   - Finally, run the command `dotnet run` to run the project!
   - Note: `dotnet run` also restores and builds the project, so you can use this single command to start the console app
5. To run tests:
   - Navigate to `{PierresBakery.Solution/PierresBakery.Tests}` in your command line.
   - Run the command `dotnet restore` to restore the dependencies that are listed in `{PierresBakery.Tests.csproj}`
   - Finally, run the command `dotnet test` to run the tests!
